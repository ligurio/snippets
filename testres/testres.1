.Sh NAME
.Nm testres
.Nd A hyperfast web frontend for software testing results written in C.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl s Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar directory
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility knits together software testing reports.
It helps to store and analyze them.
.Nm
is able to read software testing reports in three formats: JUnit, SubUnit
(versions 1 and 2) and Test Anything Protocol.
It supports two modes: console and Web application.
.Sh USAGE
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa Console application
shows a summary of multiple reports in a directory and detailed summary of a
single report.
.It Pa Web application
works as a CGI application.
Shows index of multiple reports, separate reports and supports searching.
.El
.Sh FORMATS
.Nm
supports three the most popular software testing report formats: TAP
(TestAnythingProtocol), SubUnit (version 1 and 2) and JUnit.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa JUnit "   "
The JUnit XML Report output comes from a build tool called Nant, as opposed to
the JUnit project itself - thus it can be a little tricky to nail down an
official spec for the format, even though it's widely adopted and used.
There have been a number of attempts to codify the schema, first off there is
an XSD for JUnit.
.It Pa Test Anything Protocol
is a simple text-based interface between testing modules a test harness.
.It Pa SubUnit
is a streaming protocol for test results.
It allows communication between unit tests and a test harness.
Originally developed for unit testing in 2005 by Robert Collins.
There are two major revisions of the protocol.
Version 1 was trivially human readable but had significant defects.
Version 1.1 added encapsulation of binary streams which mitigated some of the
issues but the core remained.
Version 2 shares many of the good characteristics of Version 1 and it still
models xUnit style test execution.
