Atomicity Violation is the failure event that occurs when the execution of one
concurrent component interrupts another concurrent component's execution that
must run to completion without disruption. The interruption could be caused by
a higher-priority task or an unexpected message, exception, timeout, hardware
interrupt, crash, or reboot.
