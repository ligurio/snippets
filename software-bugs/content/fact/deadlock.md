Deadlock is the failure condition that exists when a concurrent component
cannot proceed because it needs to obtain a resource (e.g., computer,
processor, and shared memory) that is held by a second one, while the first one
holds a resource that the second one needs. Thus, each deadlocked component is
forced to wait for the other one to release the resource it needs.
Occasionally, more than two concurrent components can form a deadlocked ring.
