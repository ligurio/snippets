Welcome to CRIU (Checkpoint and Restore In Userspace) on jslinux

This emulated Linux system is running client-side in your browser.
Its 16 MB root filesystem contains:

- criu binary
- crit script
- tmux(1)
- file(1)
- size, nm, and objdump utilities for inspecting resulting binaries
- nano editor

To get started, read instruction in file DEMO. You can also copy
code into the emulator by pasting it in the text area on this page
which will make it available from /dev/clipboard.
