> Thanks for the link. I read about TLAPS. It seems it relies on SMT solver to uncharge proof obligations,
> and no way for you to manually prove your claim using lower level tactics, like in Coq.
> So you rely on heuristic nature of SMT solver.
>
> About Spin[1]. If you compare the user base of Spin with the user base of TLA+ I bet you will wonder
> how many users out there  were using verification tools all those years. Lamport released his tool
> like 20 years later than SPIN started to spread. He did a great job, but there is no innovation in my opinion.
>
> I think that serious industry players like Intel, Google or NASA are using all spectre of verification tools,
> including self written tools. Intel is using there own tool for some of their chip verification AFAIK.
> My colleague went into Intel to help develop verification scripts using this tool.
>
> TLA+ has been promoted by Amazon with their latest technical report. Yes, it has more
> expressive types (records,tuples,sets), but it comes with a cost of lowering your verification performance rate.
> There are many subtle tradeoffs to make.
> 
> We tried to use several formal verification tools in our latest distributed project. We tried Spin,
> TLA+, mCRL2, Coq. There is its own philosophy, pros and cons behind each tool, but in our case
> Spin made the best job: we had to invest not so much time but found many concurrency bugs in our distributed algorithm.
> Its pros is that it has very basic data types and not very good parallelism support nor in multi thread nor in multi-node form.
