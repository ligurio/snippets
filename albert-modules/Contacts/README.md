# contacts - Albert plugin

## Description

View and copy information from your contacts using
[Albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/installing/).

To setup:

- Install [vcfxplr](https://github.com/bergercookie/vcfxplr)
- Download your contacts in the `VCF` format. Your contacts provider should have
  an export function, e.g., for Google see
  [here](https://support.google.com/contacts/answer/7199294?hl=en-GB&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)

- Enable the plugin as usual (see [parent
  project](https://github.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins) for more).
- On the first run, on `c<space>` point it to the location of the downloaded vcf
  file. On subsequent runs it should be ready to go.

You should be able to fuzzy-search through your contacts based on the contact's
full names and once you've found the contact you're looking for you should be
able to copy one of their emails, telephone numbers or full name.
